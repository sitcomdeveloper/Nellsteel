Then in 1534 the French navigator and explorer Jacques Cartier entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence and took possession of New France for King Francis I. In succeeding years Cartier ascended the St. Lawrence as far as the Lachine Rapids, to where Montrealnow stands, and attempted, with Jean-François de La Rocque to where , sieur de (lord of) Roberval, to found a colony near what is now Quebec.The colony failed, but out of these explorations the French fur trade with the Native Americans (First Nations) of the gulf and the river regions began."
